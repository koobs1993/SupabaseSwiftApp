# Introduction
If you feel like you're living someone else's life, stuck in codependent relationships, relying too much on others' opinions, and lacking inner strength, know that you're not alone. I created this app to help you find your way back to yourself, rediscover your inner power, and start living authentically. Together, we can transform your reality and uncover the person you've always dreamed of becoming. Are you ready to take the first step?

It all starts with a simple question: "I don't want this anymore... but what do I want?"

This isn't about vague dreams — it's about taking real, tangible steps. It's about your journey to yourself. Let's figure out where to begin and how to take those first steps together.

# Key Questions to Start
1. How did you get here?
   - Start by understanding: what in your life do you like, and what don't you? This is your starting point.

2. What do you truly want, if you set everyone and everything aside?
   - Imagine the world supports any choice you make. What are your true desires?
   - Why do you want money, relationships, or a career? Find your authentic answer.

3. Building a new version of you.
   - Together, we'll rebuild — creating your own rules, beliefs, and inner strength.
   - But first, we must let go of everything holding you back.

# Steps to Finding Yourself

## 1. Separating from the Past
Recognize that many of your beliefs aren't truly yours — they're voices from parents, teachers, or other significant figures. Maybe someone rejected or judged you. It's time to let that go.

## 2. The Patterns You're Living
Write down all the beliefs and assumptions you've absorbed. These patterns are your "wheel of samsara," a cycle you keep repeating.

## 3. Who is Your "Significant Other" Now?
- Are you seeking approval from a partner, boss, or friend?
- Who do you expect to finally "love you enough"?
- It's time to take that role back for yourself.

## 4. Freedom Begins with the Question: "What do I want?"
Once you've untangled your past, you can start creating a new version of yourself. From now on, you are the most important person in your life.

## 5. Physical and Emotional Health
What can you do for yourself right now?
- Heal old wounds
- Take care of your body
- Rest or sleep
- What does your inner child need today?

## 6. Your Home
Look at the space you live in:
- Does it support you or drag you down?
- Maybe it's time for a renovation or a new place that truly feels like home.

## 7. Work and Career
- Is your job what you truly want?
- If not, what would you like to change?
- What goals do you have for the next year, three years, or five years?

## 8. Money
Ask yourself honestly:
- Why do you want it?
- Are you trying to prove something to someone (like showing your mom you're a "good girl")?
- Check if your desires are truly yours or imposed by others.

## 9. Fears
- Are you afraid of failing, losing money, or not succeeding?
- But what if you succeed?
- Imagine success being your reality, not just a possibility.

## 10. Procrastination and Fear of Perfection
- Do you hesitate to start because you want everything to be perfect?
- Perfectionism can turn you into someone who never even tries.
- Replace self-criticism with self-support.

## 11. Evening Reflection
Keep a journal:
- Write down how you want to live
- Note the steps you're taking to get there
- At the end of the day, reflect: what did you do today for this new version of yourself?

## 12. Watch Yourself Transform
You'll see how your new beliefs start shaping your reality. You're creating your life, step by step, proving to yourself that it's possible.

# Final Thoughts
You don't have to be a "good girl" for anyone else. It's time to become the best version of yourself — for you.

The first step toward a new reality begins with the question: What do I truly want? Not just what, but are these truly my desires? Or are they imposed by society, family, or others, and don't reflect my authentic self?

So, let's start this journey with a focus on I. Step by step, we'll move toward uncovering your true, genuine self.

Let's begin!

# Initial Assessment
In certain situations, a different approach might work, but not in our case. To truly understand where we are starting from and what changes we'll experience, we need to define your point A — the state you're in right now. By the end of the course, this will allow you to reflect on the journey you've taken and how you've transformed.

## Self-Assessment Questionnaire
Rate your answers on a 10-point scale (1 = impossible, 10 = very easy):

1. How easy is it for you to list 5 things or situations that upset you right away?
2. How easy is it for you to list 5 things that consistently lift your spirits?
3. How easy is it for you to list 5 people whose company fills you with energy?
4. How easy is it for you to list 5 activities that drain you of energy?
5. How much do you trust yourself, your judgment, and your decisions?
6. Do you always feel that your food choices align with your desires: eating what you like, when you like, and in the quantities you want?
7. Do you always choose clothes that you truly like?
8. Do you always act in line with what you want in your professional life?
9. Do you always pursue hobbies and interests that you are passionate about, when you want, and at a frequency that feels right for you?
10. Do you always feel free to make choices about your appearance and age that are true to you?
11. Do you always feel empowered to make decisions about where you live?
12. Do you always make choices in relationships that feel right for you?
13. Do you always manage your finances in a way that aligns with your desires and goals?
14. Do you always create a home environment that reflects your true preferences?
15. Do you always act in accordance with your true character?

## Extra Exercise: Joy List
Create your own list of things that lift your spirits:
- Compile 30-100 things that consistently make you feel good
- Reference this list when feeling down or sad
- Include simple activities (walking with your dog, calling a friend, enjoying a hot bath)
- Use this as insight into what truly nourishes your soul

# Day 1: Awareness Through Food

## Today's Task
Bring mindfulness into your relationship with food through reflection on these questions:

### 1. What is my relationship with hunger right now?
- Do I actually want to eat at this moment?
- If yes, what exactly do I want to eat?

### 2. What is my current attitude toward food?
- Am I eating for nourishment and pleasure, or out of habit?
- Is boredom, stress, or anxiety influencing my decision to eat?

### 3. How do I feel about the food I choose?
- Do I genuinely enjoy the taste, texture, and aroma?
- Do I eat foods that I truly like, or do I follow external rules and restrictions?

### 4. Am I satisfied after eating?
- Did the food meet my physical and emotional needs?
- Do I feel full, or do I crave something more?

## Practical Tips for Today
- Pause before eating to ask yourself these questions
- Take photos of your meals for later reflection

## Reflection Exercise
Think about your most recent meal:
- Was it tasty? Did you enjoy it?
- What foods or dishes bring you joy? Do you eat them often?
- Did you feel satisfied afterward, both physically and emotionally?

## Exploring Your Eating Habits
Questions to consider:
- Do you follow any diets or food rules?
- How do these rules make you feel?
- Do you ever feel like you're "holding out" to meet a goal?
- Have you felt torn in a grocery store between wanting something and feeling like you "can't" have it?
- Do restrictions lead to "breaking down" and self-blame?
- Does the result of these rules feel worth the emotions and struggles?
