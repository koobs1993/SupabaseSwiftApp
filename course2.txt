Lesson 1: A New Perspective on Your Life
Overview:
Our journey begins with the most crucial step — separating yourself from external beliefs and reevaluating your relationships with parents or significant adults. They are the ones who, from the moment you were born, shaped your view of life.

When we enter this world, we know nothing about it. Everything we learn comes from our closest environment. Their words, behaviors, and beliefs form the foundation of our worldview. But here's the question: is this perspective truly yours?

On Day 1, we'll start exploring where your own beliefs begin and where the influence of others ends. This step will open the door to the freedom to think, feel, and live authentically. It's not just about analysis; it's the start of a transformation that will redefine your life.

Are you ready to uncover the truth and break free from outside influences? Day 1 will be the launchpad for your new journey!
